# Chess
This program was initially created as a custom project for a university OOP unit. 

## Minimal GUI
The app features a minimal GUI to fit the scope of the unit.

## Simple Engine
Maybe one day there will be a better chess engine here or more capabilities. For now though, a simple engine works just fine.
