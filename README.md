# Old Chess App
This program was created as a project for a university unit. There are several issues and the interface is very rudimentary. The project has been superceded by a more advanced (but still very simple) chess engine CLI. Check [here](https://linkfinitive.com) to see how that's going.

## Play

2. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/Linkfinitive/Chess.git`
3. Navigate to the folder: `cd Chess`
