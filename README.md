# Chess
This program was initially created as a custom project for a university OOP unit. 

## Minimal GUI
The app features a minimal GUI to fit the scope of the unit.

## Simple Engine
Maybe one day there will be a better chess engine here or more capabilities. For now though, a simple engine works just fine.

## Compiled Releases?
Coming soon.

## UML
The UML diagram was created using yuml.me. The text can be pasted in to their generator, or the SVG can be accessed [here](https://yuml.me/linkfinitive/chess-program.svg).
